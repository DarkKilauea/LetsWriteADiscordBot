## Music Playback

This step requires that libopus, libsodium, and ffmpeg are installed

On macOS, you can use homebrew to install these via:

``` bash
brew install opus
brew install libsodium
brew install ffmpeg
```

On windows, you will need to build or download the dlls and drop them in the
`DiscordBot\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0\` directory.

For linux, use your package manager to install these dependencies.
